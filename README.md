Repository for codecombat js files

Humans and ogres are present.

Ogres:
ogre\_base.js - file with build order and choosen hero for Ogres.
brawler.js - file with main logic for Ogre's hero and ogres army. Main idea is to focus enemy hero first and if archer count is more than 2 than focus archers. The good thing here is that we wait 10 seconds at the beginning of game for our enemy.

Humans rating ~2400
Ogres rating ~3450
